It is with immense gratitude that I acknowledge the consistent support and help
of my supervisor, Prof. Patrick P. C. Lee. Without his mentoring, this thesis
would not have been possible.

I would also like to thank my thesis committee members Prof. John C. S. Lui,
Prof. Irwin King and Prof. Guangyan Zhang, who provided me with useful advice.

I wish to thank my final-year project supervisor, Dr. Tsz-Yeung Wong for
introducing me to system research and his encouragement throughout my
undergraduate and postgraduate studies.

I consider it an honor to work with Qian Ding and Hoi-Wan Chan, who collaborate
with me very well in both CodFS and TWEEN. I also share the credit of my work
with Yan-Kit Li and Chuan Qin, who contributed to the early CodFS prototype.  

I am indebted to many friends and colleagues, including Dun Ho, Ka-Chun Lam, Mingqiang Li,
Jian Lin, Chun-Ho Ng, Chung-Pan Tang, Wai-Chung Tang, Kai-Yuan Tso, Min Xu and
many others for their support and invaluable advice, and all the fun discussions
during lunch and throughout the day. 

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family for all the
love and support.
