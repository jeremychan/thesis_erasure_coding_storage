I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my supervisor,
Prof. Patrick P. C. Lee for his consistent support and advice throughout my studies.
Without his mentoring, this thesis would not have been possible.

I also thank my final-year project supervisor, Dr. Tsz-Yeung Wong for introducing me to
system research and his continuous encouragement throughout my undergraduate and
postgraduate studies.

I have greatly benefited from my research partners Qian Ding and Hoi-Wan Chan
for their collaboration and discussions in CodFS and TWEEN. Special thanks also
to Yan-Kit Li and Chuan Qin for their contributions in the CodFS prototype.  

I would like to thank my colleagues and friends for their support and invaluable
advice.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family for all the
love and support over the years.
