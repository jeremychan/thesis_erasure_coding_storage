Our key contribution is the parity logging with reserved space (\PLR) scheme,
which keeps parity updates next to the parity chunk to mitigate disk seeks. We
also propose a workload-aware scheme to predict and adjust the reserved space
size.  To this end, we build CodFS, an erasure-coded clustered storage system
that achieves efficient updates and recovery.  We evaluate our CodFS prototype
using both synthetic and real-world traces and show that \PLR improves update
and recovery performance over pure in-place and log-based updates.  In future
work, we plan to (1) evaluate other metrics (e.g., latency) of different parity
update schemes, (2) evaluate the impact of the shrinking and merging
operations on throughput and latency, and (3) explore a more robust design of
reserved space management.  The source code of CodFS is available for
public-domain use on {\bf http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/software/codfs}.
