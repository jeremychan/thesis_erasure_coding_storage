\section{Summary}

Our key contribution is the parity logging with reserved space (\PLR) scheme,
which keeps parity updates next to the parity chunk to mitigate disk seeks. We
also propose a workload-aware scheme to predict and adjust the reserved space
size.  To this end, we build CodFS, an erasure-coded clustered storage system
that achieves efficient updates and recovery.  We evaluate our CodFS prototype
using both synthetic and real-world traces and show that \PLR improves update
and recovery performance over pure in-place and log-based updates.  

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Latency Evaluation}

We plan to evaluate other metrics (e.g., latency) of different parity
update schemes. 

\subsection{Overhead of Shrinking and Merging}

We evaluate the impact of the shrinking and merging
operations on throughput and latency. 

\subsection{Reserved Space Management Design}

We explore a more robust design of
reserved space management.
