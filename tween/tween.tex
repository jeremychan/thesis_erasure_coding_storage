We thus far focus on tackling small random writes in an erasure-coded clustered
storage. We now introduce another project called TWEEN, which tackles small
random writes in the context of an SSD RAID. In this chapter, we give an
overview of the partial-write problem in SSD RAID and describe the design of
TWEEN.

\section{Summary}

We propose TWEEN, a middleware application designed to enhance the write
efficiency and endurance of SSD RAID. TWEEN has several design goals: (1)
write efficiency and endurance, (2) metadata efficiency, (3) data availability
and (4) compatibility with off-the-shelf solutions. TWEEN utilizes the
emerging NVRAM technology as non-volatile cache.  It combines the
log-structured file system (LFS) and NVRAM to batch incoming partial writes
and flush them to SSD RAID as full-stripe writes.  It also exploits workload
characteristics to reduce LFS garbage collection overhead.  TWEEN is a
user-space application and works seamlessly with off-the-shelf SSD RAID
solutions. Our design speeds up random writes, lowers SSD garbage collection 
overhead, and extends SSD lifetime.
