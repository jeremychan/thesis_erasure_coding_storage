\section{Summary}

We propose TWEEN, a middleware application designed to enhance the write
efficiency and endurance of SSD RAID. TWEEN has several design goals: (1)
write efficiency and endurance, (2) metadata efficiency, (3) data availability
and (4) compatibility with off-the-shelf solutions. TWEEN utilizes the
emerging NVRAM technology as non-volatile cache.  It combines the
log-structured file system (LFS) and NVRAM to batch incoming partial writes
and flush them to SSD RAID as full-stripe writes.  It also exploits workload
characteristics to reduce LFS garbage collection overhead.  TWEEN is a
user-space application and works seamlessly with off-the-shelf SSD RAID
solutions. Our design speeds up random writes, lowers SSD garbage collection 
overhead, and extends SSD lifetime.
